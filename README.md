# Rust Web Example
CS410p Rust Web Dev Repo

This Repo will include all the work and assignments done by Christopher Sloggett

FOR SAM OR BART!!!

rust-web-axum is where the term project is located. As of 4/26/24, the program is no
where near complete and will be completed around Sunday the 28th. I have emailed Bart
about this and will email again once I have completed the REST submission. I am using
the two days provided on the late assignments sections of the syllabus. 

This Repo has all the main directories that will be used to access assignments
from the class CS410 Rust Web Development. All directories will be named 
appropriately so as the professor or TA can easily find all of the pertinent files
related to assignments throughout the class. 

Hope that this read me was helpful and that you enjoy the layout of the repo!
