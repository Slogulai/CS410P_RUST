This Repo will include all the work and assignments done by Christopher Sloggett

This Repo has all the main directories that will be used to access assignments
from the class CS410 Rust Web Development. All directories will be named 
appropriately so as the professor or TA can easily find all of the pertinent files
related to assignments throughout the class. 

Hope that this read me was helpful and that you enjoy the layout of the repo!
